        <h2 class="subTitle">A huge amount of things to do</h2>
        <p>Explore Iceland's natural wonders: Iceland is home to a variety of natural wonders,
            including
            glaciers, volcanoes, hot springs, and geysers. Visitors can take guided tours to explore
            these
            features and even go inside a volcano or hike on a glacier. You can also visit our favolous cities to impregnate about Iceland's 
            culture and traditions.

        <h2 class="subTitle">See the Northern Lights</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Find the right time of year:</span> The best time to see the Northern Lights in Iceland
            is from September to
            mid-April, during the winter months when the nights are longer and darker. However, it's important to note
            that the Northern Lights are a natural phenomenon, and there's no guarantee that you'll see them on any
            given night.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Find a good location:</span> To see the Northern Lights, you'll need to be in a location
            with little light
            pollution and clear skies. Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is not the best place to see the Northern
            Lights due to light pollution, so it's best to venture out into the countryside. Some popular locations for
            Northern Lights viewing include Thingvellir National Park, the Snaefellsnes Peninsula, and the Jokulsarlon
            Glacier Lagoon.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Check the weather forecast:</span> It's important to check the weather forecast before heading
                out to see the
                Northern Lights. Clear skies are essential for viewing the lights, so if the forecast calls for clouds,
                you
                may want to postpone your trip.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Book a tour:</span> There are many tour companies in Iceland that offer Northern Lights
            tours, which include
            transportation to a good viewing location, a guide to help you spot the lights, and hot drinks to keep you
            warm. Booking a tour can also increase your chances of seeing the Northern Lights, as the guides are
            experienced in finding the best viewing spots.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Be patient:</span> Seeing the Northern Lights is not guaranteed, and it can take some
            time to spot them. Be patient
            and give yourself plenty of time to wait for the lights to appear. It's also a good idea to bring warm
            clothing, as you'll be spending time outside in the cold.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Capture the moment:</span> If you're lucky enough to see the Northern Lights, be sure to
            capture the moment with
            your camera. Use a tripod and a long exposure to capture the lights, and experiment with different settings
            to get the best shot.
        </p>

            in the morning or later in
            the evening. This will also give you more time to relax and enjoy the hot spring.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Follow the rules:</span> When visiting a hot spring in Iceland, it's important to follow

        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="bold">Relax and enjoy:</span> Once you're in the hot spring, take the time to relax and enjoy
