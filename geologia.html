        <h2 class="subTitle">Tectonic Activity & Atlantic Ridge</h2>
        <p>
            Iceland's tectonic activity is largely driven by the movement of the North American and Eurasian tectonic
            plates, which meet and diverge along a prominent underwater mountain range called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
            This ridge runs down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, from north to south, and marks the boundary between
            the two plates.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the plates move apart at the ridge, magma rises from deep within the Earth to fill the gap and create new
            oceanic crust. Iceland is unique in that it sits directly atop this ridge, and so experiences some of the
            most active and dramatic tectonic activity in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            This activity is responsible for the island's many volcanoes, geysers, hot springs, and other geothermal
            features. It also means that Iceland is constantly expanding as new crust is formed at the ridge, at a rate
            of about 2.5 centimeters per year.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, Iceland's tectonic activity is closely tied to the ongoing processes of plate tectonics and
            seafloor spreading, and provides a fascinating window into the inner workings of our planet.
        </p>

        <div class="multimedia">

        </div>

        <p>
            The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent boundary, meaning that the plates are pulling away from each other and
            creating new oceanic crust in the process. As magma rises to fill the gap, it solidifies and forms new
            seafloor. Over time, this process has led to the formation of a chain of volcanic islands and seamounts,
            including Iceland.
        </p>
                
        <p>
            Iceland's location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge means that it is one of the most tectonically active places on
            Earth, with frequent volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and other geologic events. The island's landscape is
            shaped by this activity, with towering volcanoes, vast glaciers, and hot springs that bubble up from deep
            within the Earth's crust.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an important feature of Iceland's geology, and provides a unique
            opportunity to study the processes of plate tectonics and seafloor spreading up close.

        <h2 class="subTitle">Geysers</h2>
        <p>
            Iceland's geysers are one of the country's most iconic natural wonders. These geysers are formed by
            underground chambers of hot water and steam that periodically erupt in spectacular fashion, shooting boiling
            water and steam high into the air. The most famous of these geysers is Geysir, which gave its name to all
            other geysers around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Located in the Haukadalur valley, Geysir is one of the oldest known geysers and has been erupting for over a
            thousand years. While its eruptions have become less frequent in recent decades, the nearby Strokkur geyser
            erupts every few minutes, shooting water up to 30 meters in the air.
        </p>

        <p>
            Visitors to Iceland can witness the awe-inspiring power of these geysers up close, as well as enjoy the
            otherworldly landscapes that surround them. The geysers are a testament to the unique geological activity
            that occurs on this island nation, and they continue to captivate visitors from around the world.
