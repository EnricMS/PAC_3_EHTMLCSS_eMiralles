        <h2 class="subTitle">Iceland's Demography</h2>
        <p>
            Iceland is a sparsely populated island nation located in the North Atlantic Ocean. As of 2021, its
            estimated
            population is around 366,130, with a relatively even distribution of men and women. The majority of the
            population resides in urban areas, with the capital city of Reykjavik being the most populous city.
        </p>

        <p>
            The population of Iceland is largely of Nordic descent, with most Icelanders being descendants of
            Norwegian
            and Celtic settlers who arrived in the 9th and 10th centuries. Immigrants make up a small percentage of
            the
            population, with the largest groups being Poles, Lithuanians, and Filipinos.
        </p>

        <p>
            The population of Iceland is also aging, with a median age of around 37 years. The birth rate is
            relatively low, with an average of 1.6 children born per woman, and the life expectancy is among the
            highest in the world, with an average of 83 years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, Iceland's demography is characterized by a small, homogeneous population that is gradually
            aging and becoming more urbanized.

        <h2 class="subTitle">Iceland's Geology</h2>
        <p>
            Iceland's geology is unique and fascinating, as it is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the
            Eurasian and North American tectonic plates meet. This geological activity has resulted in the formation
            of a diverse range of landscapes, including volcanoes, glaciers, hot springs, geysers, and fjords.
        </p>

        <p>
            Iceland is home to over 130 volcanic mountains, 30 of which are active. The island's most famous
            volcano, Eyjafjallajökull, erupted in 2010, causing widespread disruption to air travel across Europe.
            Iceland is also home to Vatnajökull, the largest glacier in Europe, covering over 8% of the country's
            surface area.
        </p>

        <p>
            Geothermal activity is another prominent feature of Iceland's geology, with hot springs and geysers
            dotting the landscape. The country's capital city, Reykjavik, is heated entirely by geothermal energy,
            which is harnessed from underground reservoirs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tectonic activity in Iceland also results in frequent earthquakes, and the island's location on the edge
            of the Arctic Circle means that it experiences long periods of daylight in the summer and darkness in the
            winter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, Iceland's geology is characterized by its unique location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which has
            resulted in the formation of a diverse range of geological features and landscapes.
